Our society faces an evolutionary challenge stemming from a myriad of issues within the field of science. **We aim to contribute to the solution by advancing scientific progress.** We strive to collaborate closely with the scientific community to showcase how decentralization, new tools, and blockchain-related technologies are revolutionizing the practice of science for the better.

Some of the issues are:
- **Lack of funding**
- **Time wasted in bureaucracy**
- **Unanswered funding requests**
- **Lack of resources**
- **Lack of access to information**
- **Challenges in reproducing research**
- **Language barriers**
- **Failed system of scientific publishing and peer review**

Among many other challenges and barriers to research advancement, one significant hurdle in Latin America is the lack of essential resources for scientific and technological progress.

Sadly, **many scientists in our region remain unaware of the tools and advantages offered by the blockchain ecosystem**, a missed opportunity for scientific growth.

In response, **we are committed to advocating for the decentralization of scientific knowledge** and resources while exploring alternative funding avenues.

We strongly advocate for **democratizing scientific knowledge** and fostering an **open-source culture** where collective efforts significantly enhance human well-being.

Therefore, we endeavor to propagate knowledge throughout **Latin America**, amplify the visibility of scientific initiatives, and actively participate in advancing scientific progress. Through these efforts, we envision a future in our region that is brighter and more prosperous for all.

**Our mission**: Driving scientific progress in Latin America.

We operate as a public good to advance Latin American science, serving as a nexus between the scientific community and the blockchain ecosystem.

Our primary goal is to empower small foundations, scientific organizations, and researchers by providing them with visibility and the necessary tools to propel their projects forward.

We are committed to establishing meaningful connections within the scientific community through educational partnerships, events, Twitter engagements, forums, and various other platforms.

Our overarching objective is to stay informed about and disseminate insights regarding the state of science in the region.
